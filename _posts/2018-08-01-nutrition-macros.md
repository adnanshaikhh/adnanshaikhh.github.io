Organic cells are composed of molecules that based on 4 fundamental elements:
**Carbon**, **Hydrogen**, **Nitrogen** & **Oxygen** (and more!) Combining these
elements, you can create 4 major macromolecules **Carbohydrates**, **Lipids** &
**Proteins**

## Carbohydrates (sugars, starches, cellulose)[^1]

![carb]
{: align="middle"}

Made from joining H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> by plants during photosynthesis.  
**Monomer**: Simple sugars: CH<sub>2</sub>O
Bread, cereal, potatoes, fruits, vegetables, and pasta are made mostly of carbohydrates (sugars and starches).  
**Three main functions**: Energy for cells, structural support, cell-cell communication.  

### **Monosaccharides (simple sugars; monomers)**  
**Function**: Energy for cells  
**Examples**:  
* Glucose: grape sugar, corn sugar, dextrose  
* Fructose: honey  
* Galactose: part of milk sugar (lactose)  

### **Disaccharides (double sugars) or oligosaccharides (short-sugars)**  
**Function**: Energy for cells  
**Examples**:
* Maltose = glucose - glucose (brewing beer)  
* Lactose = glucose - galactose (milk sugar)  
* Sucrose = glucose - fructose (table sugar)  

### **Polysaccharides (long chains of sugar polymers)**  
These sugar polymers are not _sweet_ although they are made up of repeating
glucose monomers.

* **Starch (plants), glycogen (animals)**

  **Function**: Energy storage  
  **Examples**:  
    * Potatoes - pure starch!
    * Pasta, bread, crackers - ground up wheat starch  

  **Structure**: 1-4 linkage of a-glucose  
  **Note**: Animal cells can't make sugars "from scratch", but can polymerize plant sugars into glycogen , a related storage polymer.  
  Once we have eaten, monosaccharides, disaccharides and starches are converted to the monomer glucose, our bodys preferred fuel, and circulate through the blood (reserves are stored in our bodies as glycogen).

* **Cellulose (plants), chitin (insects, fungi)**
  **Function**: Structural support  
  **Examples**:
    * Cellulose: Paper, wood, cotton, the chewy stuff in celery
    * Chitin: The crunchy exoskeleton of insects and shrimp, the soft spongy
      material that makes up a mushroom.  

  **Structure**: 1-4 linkage of b-glucose  
  **Note**: These structural polymers are almost indigestable, which is a good
  thing since they function as structural support! Some animals (like cows) and
  insects (like termites) have special bacteria in their intestines that can
  break the 1-4 linkage of b-glucose, but we cannot break this bond!  

## Proteins

![protein]
{: align="middle"}
Proteins form about 50% of the dry weight of most cells. They are also the most
complex type of macromolecule because there are 20 different monomers called
amino acids. The way these monomers are put together gives each protein its own
unique structure and function.

All proteins are polymers constructed from a set of 20 amino acid monomers
linked end-to-end, up to thousands of amino acids long, each in a unique 3-D
shape.

Our bodies can make 11 of the ~20 amino acids--the other 9 amino acids must be
obtained from our diet. 

**Essential amino acids (must be obtained by the food we eat)**: _Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine_  
**Non-essential amino acids (our bodies can make these amino acids)**: _Arginine ,Tyrosine, Glycine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Asparagine Cystine, Histidine, Proline, Alanine. (there are 2 rare amino acids as well - Taurine and Hydroxyproline)_  

## Lipids

### **Triacylglycerols (fats and oils)** 

![triacylglycerol]
{: align="middle"}


* **Structure** : Made from 1 glycerol + 3 fatty acid tails = tri-acylglycerol  
* **Example** : Fats: Butter, lard Oils: Corn oil, olive oil, margerine
* **Note** : Vary in length and location of double bonds in tail  

Two major functions of fats and oils:  
1. **Energy storage** -- Fats are a more compact fuel than starch
* Fat contains **twice** the energy-rich (C-H) bonds as glucose
* Fat stores **twice** as much energy as glucose
* Fat produces **twice** as many calories (9 kcal/gm vs 4 kcal/gm) when burned
* Unfortunately, you need to put **twice** as much energy to burn off a pound of excess fat than you do of glycogen...

2. **Cushions and insulates the body and nerves** -- Each and every one of your nerves is wrapped in a lipid-rich layer called the myelin sheath.


### **Diacylglycerides (phospholipids)**  
Lipid bilayers (the plasma membrane of every cell and the membranes within eukaryotic cells)

![diglyceride]
{: align="middle"}  

**Structure**: Similar to a triacylglycerol, but has only 2 fatty acid tails, and in addition has a phosphate group = (1 glycerol, 2 fatty acids, and a -PO4).
The -PO4 makes the glycerol "head" water soluble, or hydrophilic.
The long hydrocarbon tail is hydrophobic.  
**Function**: Due to this "amphipathic" nature (both water-loving and water-hating regions in a single molecule), phospholipids self assemble into bilayers that shield the tail from water = forming membranes (phospholipid bilayers!)  

### **Steroids (cholesterol, steroid hormones)**  
**Structure**: Considered to be a "cousin" of fats - and are made from lipids. Have no fatty acids in their structure, but are very hydrophobic
**Functions of Chloesterol**:  

1. Help to maintain membrane fluidity, pliability and resilience in membranes of animals, which have high amounts or rigid, saturated fatty acids.
2. Sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen and progesterone) are all made from cholesterol  

Cholesterol gets a 'bad rap" in our diet, but has CRUCIAL roles in the
functioning of our cells - we wouldn't be able to live without it!  

However, too much cholestereol in the diet is known to be a factor in
atherosclerosis and heart disease.  

Cholesterol circulates in the bloodstream bound to carrier 'lipo-proteins'. High
Density Lipoprotein (HDL - the "Good" kind) carries blood cholesterol to the
liver where is can be eliminated from the body. Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL -
the "Bad" kind) deposits blood cholesterol in the artery walls, where it can
lead to constriction of blood vessels, heart disease, heart attacks, etc.  

### Fats compared:

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Saturated (fats)** - No double bonds; Saturated with hydrogens.                                                                     | Solid at room temperature: animal fats (bacon, lard, butter, palm oil, coconut oil). These fats raise total blood cholesterol level, HDL and LDL, and have been shown to increase  the risk of coronary heart disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **MonoUnsaturated (oils)** - A double bond ("kink") forms (loss of 2 hydrogens).                                                      | Liquids at room temperature: olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil. These are the GOOD fats--they lower total blood cholesterol by raising HDL (good) cholesterol and lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **PolyUnsaturated (oils)** - More than one double bond ("kink") forms (loss of more than 2 hydrogens).                                | Liquids at room temperature: corn oil, soybean oil, Omega-3 and -6 fish oils. These are also the GOOD fats--they lower total blood cholesterol by lowering both HDL (good) and LDL (bad) cholesterol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Hydrogenated oils (margarine, crisco)** - Hydrogens are added synthetically to plant oils to create trans-fatty saturated acids. | Solids at room temperature--these oils are factory-made by adding hydrogens to liquid vegetable oil, creating a solid shortening or margarine. Trans-fats have adverse effects on health, they raise both LDL (bad) cholesterol and lower HDL (good) cholesterol levels and can be even worse that saturated animal fat in the development of coronary heart disease. |
