Delaying gratification is hard and it’s as if the goals that I embark upon as I
get older seem to push this feeling further and further away. Over the past few
years, I’ve experimented with different techniques to get myself to work,
whether that be structuring my environment to prime habits more easily, setting
up negative reinforcement methods like Beeminder or just through practicing
mindful awareness by journaling. What I’ve found is that while I haven’t had
any long-lasting success with any of these methods, I’ve already mastered one
form of getting uncomfortable work done, going to the gym.

Back in 2016, when I had just begun working out, picturing myself down to 10%
body fat seemed like an absolutely unattainable prospect. I’d somewhat accepted
that it probably wasn’t going to happen anytime soon. But I still stuck by,
going to the gym every day, just putting in an hour’s worth of my time. Over
time I could see the difference, the pounds wearing off and slowly packing on
muscle. It taught me valuable lessons about compounding work, embracing
discomfort, delaying gratification and the whole just-get-started mentality.

What I’ve found is that it’s better to stop romanticizing what it would feel
like to have achieved the goal, but instead to fall in love with the process of
doing the actual task itself. Each goal is different and spending a while trying
to figure out what works best for you is a worthwhile investment. If you can
make that happen you really don’t need to track anything anymore, and your habit
naturally sticks as you no longer feel the resistance of getting started.
