4 months ago, I decided to abstain from using social media and overall it's been going really well. I have to admit though I haven't been completely off for good. I keep slipping back in everytime I'm bored but I'm glad I decided to mute everyone when I did quit. The only thing I do now is go through everyone's greyed out stories which aren't really interesting. Once I got comfortable living without social media, it got me thinking about other omnipresent services I use in my life. Namely, Google.

Google's free offerings are everywhere. From Gmail to Maps to Android to Chrome to Youtube, you get the point. Each of these services are offered for free with the only catch being that you're giving away your behavioural data. Depending on how comfortable you are with a corporation knowing so much about you, there's two ways out of this.

* One, you could just block all ads using a chrome extension or a network wide pi-hole.
* Two, you could take back control by diversifying these services either from other providers, self-hosting or other primitive alternatives.

## Taking back control

I tried the latter approach recently. My plan of action was to remove OxygenOS off of my OnePlus 6 and install LineageOS. Here's where my experience significantly started deteriorating. LineageOS, while I respect the endeavor and effort is incredibly buggy compared to commercial offerings. This was something that came as a surprise to me. Open source software on the desktop has always been great, but in hindsight that's probably because the desktop has had a head start compared to what's available on Android. Simple things that I'd taken for granted at this point like push notifications, lag-free touch input, a somewhat functioning free and open source app store, all buggy.

But even after all that, I decided to hold on for one more day. I assumed I'd be able to get over the initial discomfort like I managed to with social media. The very same day I flashed this brand spanking new Google-free ROM, I had go out to meet a friend. With some great luck I happened to get stuck in the worst traffic jam I've faced this entire year. Google Maps could have warned me, I even tried downloading it half way though the jam to find an alternate route, but nothing was working. It was if I set myself back 10 years. My time spent in the traffic jam with essentially a dumbphone at this point highlighted a few things to me. I realized how I'd been taking these services for granted and the true utility that these tools provide. On the other hand, a question that kept going through my mind was, whether replacing these tools with open source implementations were truly free?

## Free is ambiguous
The English language doesn't distinguish between free as in 'free of charge' or free as in 'liberty'. So you have two terms coined by the community to differentiate them, 'free as in beer' and 'free as in speech'. Louis Rossman in one of his videos mentions one key freedom not talked about -- 'Free as in free time'. Sure I could self host and set up contact syncing, a local photos repository, my own mail server, etc. Setting all this up would be 'free' as in 'free beer' since it's freeware (ignoring the cost of hosting) and free as in 'free speech' since the software is open source. But it doesn't account for the free time I've lost setting up and maintaining these services.

The next question that comes up is, is the benefit worth it? Is the upfront cost of time spent setting up these services -- that could be spent doing other things -- worth it? Or do I just bend over and pay the price of giving away my data to a corporation? A common argument mentioned is that you shouldn't have a problem with sharing your data if you have nothing to hide. This argument is flawed and it's analogous to saying you don't care about free speech since you have nothing to say.

## What am I going to do?
I'm not entirely sure yet. I truly feel it's a waste of time reinventing the wheel for solutions that have already been solved. Google's services are nothing short of magical with some incredible utility to them. Perhaps once open source software catches up in the mobile space, I might consider taking another look. Till then I guess I have no choice to but to stick around.
