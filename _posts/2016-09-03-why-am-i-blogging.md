Teaching someone a particular concept always reinforced my learning, so I
figured writing down technical posts would be a great resource to both whoever
might enjoy reading my melodramatic writing and for myself, to serve as a
reference in case I forget it later. It's a bit daunting though, writing about
something you feel you haven't mastered, i.e. telling someone "How you should do
X". See [impostor syndrome][impostor]

I'd like to think of this process as documentation of my learning process
