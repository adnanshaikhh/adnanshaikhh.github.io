You've probably heard of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and AUC
values used to score and rank classification algorithms. However, for the
longest time I've found them unintuitive. So my fellow [rubber ducklings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), let's
break down some basic properties.

An ROC curve plots the performance of a binary classifier under various threshold
settings. This is the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR).
rate. TPR is the proportion positive correctly classified (TP/P) and  False
positive rate (FPR) is calculated by 1-TNR (TN/N).
If your classifier predicts “true” more often, it will have more true positives
(good) but also more false positives (bad). If your classifier is more
conservative, predicting “true” less often, it will have fewer false positives
but fewer true positives as well. The ROC curve is a graphical representation of
this tradeoff.
An ideal classifier would have a 100% true positive rate and
0% false positive rate.

When observing the plot, if the plot follow the straight line from lower left to
upper right, then the classifier cannot differentiate between negative and
postive data. If the curve tend to bend to the upper left, then the model can
differentiate the actual positive and negative data. On the contrary, if the
curve tend to bend to lower right, then it just completely wrong prediction
model.

To performance of a classifier model is then calculated by calculating the Area
Under Curve (AUC). The AUC score will range between 0 and 1. The higher the
value of AUC, usually the better the model is. Quick facts, a perfect classifier
has an AUC of 1, whereas a random classifier has one of 0.5. A value below 0.5
means that you can invert your outputs to get a better performance so you
probably did something wrong.

### A final note of historical interest[^1]
You may be wondering where the name "Receiver Operating Characteristic" came
from. ROC analysis is part of a field called "Signal Detection Theory" developed
during World War II for the analysis of radar images. Radar operators had to
decide whether a blip on the screen represented an enemy target, a friendly
ship, or just noise. Signal detection theory measures the ability of radar
receiver operators to make these important distinctions. Their ability to do so
was called the Receiver Operating Characteristics. It was not until the 1970's
that signal detection theory was recognized as useful for interpreting medical
test results.
