Exercise FAQ
======

#### Lift heavy to get strong?
**Yep**, those who routinely lifted at least **60%** of their 1 rep max over the course
of 6 weeks enjoyed significantly higher strength gains than those who trained
below 60%. _Hypertrophy remained the same though._

#### How heavy though for hypertrophy?
Populations who trained at or above **60%** of their 1 rep max, and those who
trained below both experienced virtually the same results in measured
hypertrophy.

#### Ideal amount of protein consumption for muscle growth?
**Yes.** Benefits typically plateaued at protein consumption of **~1.6g/kg or .73g/lb**
of body weight

#### Train to failure to maximize gains?
**Nope.**

#### Does lifting with bands or chains make you stronger?
**Yes.** Those who incorporated VRT were stronger by **5 kilos** in 1 rep max
testing on average.

#### Can coffee be part of a healthy diet?
**Yes!** Infact it should be part of your diet unless you have high blood pressure.

```
"...coffee was associated with a probable decreased risk of breast, colorectal,
colon, endometrial, and prostate cancers; cardiovascular disease and mortality;
Parkinsonâ€™s disease; and type-2 diabetes."
```

#### Does cardio before resistance training reduce strength? 
**Yes**, those who lift before cardio had **7% larger strength** gains but _hypertrophy
was unaffected_.

#### Creatine?
**Yes.** 
* Those supplementing enjoyed an **8% increase** in the back squat.
* Subjects also were able to **increase** strength gains in the bench press.
* Subjects also enjoyed a small, however **significant improved** rate of hypertrophy.

#### Can consuming caffeine help boost strength and power?
**Yes.** Those supplementing with caffeine experienced small, however,
significant increases in both power and strength.
_Subjects took anywhere from **4.3-6.5 mg** of caffeine per kg of body weight_

#### Do artificial sweeteners impact blood glucose levels?
**No.** There was no significant glycemic impact of artificial sweeteners on
average.
_Aspartame, saccharin, steviosides, and sucralose were all included in the examinations._

#### Is glutamine supplementation good for anything?
**Nope,** just a little bit for weight loss.

#### Does protein supplementation improve gains in bone density?
**No.**

#### Can lifting weights help with symptoms of depression?
**Yes.** Resistance training appears to be even more effective at reducing
depressive symptoms than aerobic exercise.
