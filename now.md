_MFW my entire career depends on whether I can reverse a linked list in 20 minutes_

I'm currently in my first year at grad school in the states. My thoughts on grad school are pretty mixed. I honestly didn't know what to expect coming into it, but now it just feels like a full-time job juggling seemingly disjoint tasks simultaneously. The worst of which definitely has to be internship hunting. Anybody who's been through this period knows how much of an absolute drain it is both on your time that's spent practicing questions that serve as a proxy metric for job success and your self-esteem when you begin doubting yourself when companies don't respond to you.

I can get over the ghosting bit, I'm pretty pessimistic that way and usually consider the worst outcome. Whiteboarding, on the other hand, involves what essentially amounts to grinding through some 200+ questions on leetcode until you've run out of questions which test for that _aha_ moment. 
Standardized testing of any kind always runs the risk of people giving the exam to overfit themselves to the testing pattern. Leetcode/ whiteboarding is no different. The questions themselves aren't that difficult if encountered in a normal job scenario, it's the added stress of having a tight time constraint and having your future ride on whether you can validate a binary search tree that usually gets me (and others I've heard.)

There isn't much substance to this rant because, at the end of the day, I can't suggest other testing alternatives. Take-home projects are time-consuming for both the interviewer and the interviewee, and it's also really hard to combat cheating on take-home coding quizzes.

If you can't beat the system, then just keep grinding till you're better at it I guess? It's a shitty system that just tests your willpower to get back in the game again and again. But the nice thing about practicing leetcode questions is that it's _quantifiable_. About a year ago I'd heard of this service called Beeminder that tracks quantifiable goals of any kind, and it sets daily goals based on some overarching high-level one. Here's the real kicker, if you miss a particular goal/ deadline, it charges your credit card based on some preset amount.

Here's my beeminder leetcode graph

Here's hoping this can keep me in line and make me the 10x engineer that every company dreams of that can reverse linked lists in less than 5 minutes.

This page is a public declaration of my priorities and a reminder to myself for times when I'm feeling unfocused. It was inspired by Thomas Frank's impossible list and Derek Sivers' now page
