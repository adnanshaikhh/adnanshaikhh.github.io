# Beginner's Creed

I am a beginner.  
I am entering a new game about which I know nothing.  
I do not yet know how to move in this game.  
I see many other people playing in this game now.  
This game has gone on for many years prior to my arrival.  
I am a new recruit arriving here for the first time.  
I see value to me in learning to navigate in this domain.  

There is much for me to learn:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The basic terminology*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The basic rules*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The basic moves of action*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The basic strategies*

While I am learning these things I may feel various negative reactions:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Overwhelmed at how much there is to learn*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Insecure that I do not know what to do*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Inadequate that I lack the capacity to do this*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Frustrated and discouraged that my progress is so slow*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Angry that I have been given insufficient guidance*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Anxious that I will never perform up to expectations on which my career depends*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Embarrassed that everyone can see my mistakes*

But these moods are part of being a beginner. It does not serve my goal and
ambition to dwell in them. Instead,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*If I make a mistake, I will ask what lesson does this teach.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*If I make a discovery, I will celebrate my aha! moment.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*If I feel alone, I will remember that I have many friends ready to help.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*If I am stuck, I will ask for help from my teachers.*

Over time, I will make fewer mistakes.  
I will gain confidence in my abilities.  
I will need less guidance from my teachers and friends.  
I will gain familiarity with the game.  
I will be able to have intelligent conversations with others in the game.  
I will not cause breakdowns for promises that I lack the competence to keep.  
I have an ambition to become competent, perhaps even proficient or expert in
this game. But for now,  
I am a beginner.
