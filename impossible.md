My Impossible list
======

![impossible-banner]

I've always had a vague idea of the kind of experiences I wanted to pursue, but they were all kind of just stuck in my head. I never really worked on any of them because it was such a mishmash keeping a mental inventory--kinda like holding water with your hands. Over the course of a few days, and with a little inspiration from Thomas Frank, I wrote down my version of the impossible list--an ever-evolving list of experiences that build upon each other, inspire others as well as yourself, and implore you to take action. Here's what I've come up with:
